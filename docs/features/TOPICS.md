## Advanced record browsing in table format

Thanks to Kouncil's convenient way of presenting records in a table format, even large amounts of
complex messages can be easily browsed. You can choose between browsing a single partition or a
topic as a whole. If you wish to examine any of the messages more closely, you can view its source,
copy it to a clipboard, or even post it again.
